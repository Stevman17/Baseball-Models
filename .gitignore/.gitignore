Exercise 1
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

name = input("What is your name: ")
age = int(input("How old are you: "))
year = str((2014 - age)+100)
print(name + " will be 100 years old in the year " + year)
What is your name: Steve
How old are you: 32
Steve will be 100 years old in the year 2082
Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message.

copies = input("How many times should I print this?")
for i in range(int(copies)):
    print(name + " will be 100 years old in the year " + year)
How many times should I print this?5
Steve will be 100 years old in the year 2082
Steve will be 100 years old in the year 2082
Steve will be 100 years old in the year 2082
Steve will be 100 years old in the year 2082
Steve will be 100 years old in the year 2082
copies = input("How many times should I print this?")
statement = name + " will be 100 years old in the year " + year + "\n"
print(statement * int(copies))
How many times should I print this?5
Steve will be 100 years old in the year 2082
Steve will be 100 years old in the year 2082
Steve will be 100 years old in the year 2082
Steve will be 100 years old in the year 2082
Steve will be 100 years old in the year 2082

Exercise 2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

number = input("What number shall we check?")
if int(number)%2 == 0:
    print("Your number is even!")
else: 
    print("Your number is odd!")
    
What number shall we check?5
Your number is odd!
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message

num = input("What number shall we check?")
check = input("What are we dividing it by?")

if int(num) % int(check)== 0:
    print("This divides nicely!")
else:
    print("This doesn't divide nicely!")
What number shall we check?6
What are we dividing it by?2
This divides nicely!/n
Exercise 3
Take a list and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
for i in a:
    if i < 5:
        print(i)
    
1
1
2
3
Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.

new = []

for i in a:
    if i < 5:
        new.append(i)

print(new)
[1, 1, 2, 3]
Do this is one line

new = []
new = new.append(a < 5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-5-f4aff13387bc> in <module>()
      1 new = []

TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'list' and 'int'
print(list(filter(lambda x: (x <= 5) , a)))
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

less_than = input("What are we filtering for?")

print(list(filter(lambda x: (x <= int(less_than)) , a)))
What are we filtering for?6
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
Excercise 4
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

num = input("What number are we dividing?")

print("Your number is divisible by:")

for i in range(1,int(num)):
    if int(num)%i == 0:
       print(i)
    
What number are we dividing?6
Your number is divisible by:
1
2
3
